# An attempt at maintaining Jersey 1.x for a legacy application

## Goals

* drop-in replacement of the legacy dependency
* migrate old dependencies to address cve, as much as possible
* refactor code to remove tight coupling with obsolete/unsecure dependencies that cannot be migrated further.

## End of life

* when not needed anymore
* If no significant commit (other than making a README or experimenting), this repository will be deleted.
* If some commit worthy of being kept around are made, this repository will be archived only.
